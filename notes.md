TODO:
 <!-- - Create molecule pages for the different states of water (one page for all three). -->
 <!-- - Create molecule pages for the different carbon allotropes. -->
 <!-- - Create a page that takes the dropdown page idea for the VSEPR example but also displays the lobes. -->
 - Orbitals with two different JSmol windows (1st two links in email)
 - Look into displaying JSmol over the page instead of a new page.
 - Look into the utility of the 'set picking' command 

` $ cd chem`
` $ http-server`
open the port-website it lists
